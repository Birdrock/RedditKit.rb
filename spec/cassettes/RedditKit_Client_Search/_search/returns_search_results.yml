        HTML/CSS, a couple kinds of assembly, C#/VB, others I wish I could forget
        and of course plain old C. I keep going back to C++ because I have a strong
        proficiency with it. I have the feeling I can make it do anything. I have
        made it solve some interesting problems. There are other reasons too, but
        this seems like enough to convey where I am coming from. I invested real time
        and effort gaining that proficiency, so I will use C++ when practical an invest
        more time learning something else when C++ is not practical.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I
        see a ton of Rubyists talking about Elixir and Node.js as somekind of wholesale
        replacement for Ruby. I understand that the two newer systems provide interesting
        interactions with threading systems. That does not seem like a reason to dump
        a whole language, a language with multiple independent healthy implementations
        (jRuby, Rubunius, Maglev, etc...), particularly when some of them have fixed
        threading performance. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I am missing the
        point, maybe this is just about jumping to some popular new toy now that us
        old fogeys are onto Ruby? Of course not, all the people I read about in blogs
        and watch in talks at the countless Ruby conferences seem like pragmatic people
        interested in getting stuff done. Ruby seems like an excellent tool for getting
        stuff done. It is extremely easy to express complex ideas quickly. It has
        an excellent system for handling libraries. It has access to awesome performance
        via its C-API. If C is not your thing, It is mature enough that it is getting
        performance optimizations with every new release (of MRI/Yarv at least). These
        people invested significant time and effort learning Ruby, will their pragmatism
        just let them throw that away?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my perspective
        is wrong and no-one is leaving Ruby? But it seems every other conference talk
        someone mentions Elixir while spitting Ruby&amp;#39;s name.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps,

        proficiency with it. I have the feeling I can make it do anything. I have
        made it solve some interesting problems. There are other reasons too, but
        this seems like enough to convey where I am coming from. I invested real time

        see a ton of Rubyists talking about Elixir and Node.js as somekind of wholesale
        replacement for Ruby. I understand that the two newer systems provide interesting
        interactions with threading systems. That does not seem like a reason to dump
        a whole language, a language with multiple independent healthy implementations
        (jRuby, Rubunius, Maglev, etc...), particularly when some of them have fixed
        threading performance. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I am missing the

        and watch in talks at the countless Ruby conferences seem like pragmatic people
        interested in getting stuff done. Ruby seems like an excellent tool for getting
        stuff done. It is extremely easy to express complex ideas quickly. It has
        an excellent system for handling libraries. It has access to awesome performance
        via its C-API. If C is not your thing, It is mature enough that it is getting
        performance optimizations with every new release (of MRI/Yarv at least). These
        people invested significant time and effort learning Ruby, will their pragmatism
        just let them throw that away?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my perspective

        started learning Ruby a few months ago and I bought myself a Microsoft Kinect
        Cam as an early X-Mas gift. Of course I&amp;#39;m using Linux (yes your OS-X
        is fine too) and don&amp;#39;t even own an X-Box 360 ... so I started the
        hacking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a short time of fiddling with C, I
        remembered how much it tends to get on my nerves and how much I love Ruby,
        so I thought &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Why not write some Kinect stuff with
        Ruby?!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. After a bit of googling I found exactly no
        other projects except&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;---- &lt;a href=\\\"http://openkinect.org/wiki/Ruby_Wrapper#Sample_Code\\\"&gt;this
        one&lt;/a&gt; ----&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;which was empty and so I decided
        to &lt;strong&gt;post my first code snippet there&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly
        nobody reacted so I have to assume that this project is dead. But what about
        you? &lt;em&gt;Anyone interested in bringing some of the Kinect functionality
        to Ruby?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What &lt;del&gt;I&lt;/del&gt;
        we managed to do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Control

        accelerometer data&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What
        is missing (tried but failed):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Get

        \"selftext\": \"Hi there,\\n\\nI started learning Ruby a few months ago and
        I bought myself a Microsoft Kinect Cam as an early X-Mas gift. Of course I'm
        using Linux (yes your OS-X is fine too) and don't even own an X-Box 360 ...
        so I started the hacking.\\n\\nAfter a short time of fiddling with C, I remembered
        how much it tends to get on my nerves and how much I love Ruby, so I thought
        \\\"**Why not write some Kinect stuff with Ruby?!**\\\". After a bit of googling
        I found exactly no other projects except\\n\\n---- [this one](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Ruby_Wrapper#Sample_Code)
        ----\\n\\nwhich was empty and so I decided to **post my first code snippet
        there**.\\n\\nSadly nobody reacted so I have to assume that this project is
        dead. But what about you? *Anyone interested in bringing some of the Kinect
        functionality to Ruby?*\\n\\n\\n**What ~~I~~ we managed to do:**\\n\\n * Control
        the Kinects motor\\n * Control the Kinects LED\\n * Get accelerometer data\\n\\n**What
        is missing (tried but failed):**\\n\\n * Get an image from the RGB cam\\n
        * Get an image from the depth cam\\n * ~~Get accelerometer data~~\\n\\n\\n\\n**TL;DR:**
