        fundamentally do not understand the perspective many Rubyists have. I am not
        saying it anything is bad, I am saying &lt;em&gt;I do not understand&lt;/em&gt;.
        I just have a different perspective. I don&amp;#39;t understand why pragmatic
        people who don&amp;#39;t seem to be early adopters are leaving a good tool
        for tools that should only appeal to early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please,
        let me explain my perspective. I have been working primarily with C++ the
        past 15, during that time I have dabbled with Java, PHP, Lua, Perl, Pascal,
        HTML/CSS, a couple kinds of assembly, C#/VB, others I wish I could forget
        and of course plain old C. I keep going back to C++ because I have a strong
        proficiency with it. I have the feeling I can make it do anything. I have
        made it solve some interesting problems. There are other reasons too, but
        this seems like enough to convey where I am coming from. I invested real time
        and effort gaining that proficiency, so I will use C++ when practical an invest
        more time learning something else when C++ is not practical.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I
        see a ton of Rubyists talking about Elixir and Node.js as somekind of wholesale
        replacement for Ruby. I understand that the two newer systems provide interesting
        interactions with threading systems. That does not seem like a reason to dump
        a whole language, a language with multiple independent healthy implementations
        (jRuby, Rubunius, Maglev, etc...), particularly when some of them have fixed
        threading performance. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I am missing the
        point, maybe this is just about jumping to some popular new toy now that us
        old fogeys are onto Ruby? Of course not, all the people I read about in blogs
        and watch in talks at the countless Ruby conferences seem like pragmatic people
        interested in getting stuff done. Ruby seems like an excellent tool for getting
        stuff done. It is extremely easy to express complex ideas quickly. It has
        an excellent system for handling libraries. It has access to awesome performance
        via its C-API. If C is not your thing, It is mature enough that it is getting
        performance optimizations with every new release (of MRI/Yarv at least). These
        people invested significant time and effort learning Ruby, will their pragmatism

        SC_ON --&gt;\", \"selftext\": \"I fundamentally do not understand the perspective
        many Rubyists have. I am not saying it anything is bad, I am saying *I do
        not understand*. I just have a different perspective. I don't understand why
        pragmatic people who don't seem to be early adopters are leaving a good tool
        for tools that should only appeal to early adopters.\\n\\nPlease, let me explain
        my perspective. I have been working primarily with C++ the past 15, during
        that time I have dabbled with Java, PHP, Lua, Perl, Pascal, HTML/CSS, a couple
        kinds of assembly, C#/VB, others I wish I could forget and of course plain
        old C. I keep going back to C++ because I have a strong proficiency with it.
        I have the feeling I can make it do anything. I have made it solve some interesting
        problems. There are other reasons too, but this seems like enough to convey
        where I am coming from. I invested real time and effort gaining that proficiency,
        so I will use C++ when practical an invest more time learning something else
        when C++ is not practical.\\n\\nI see a ton of Rubyists talking about Elixir
        and Node.js as somekind of wholesale replacement for Ruby. I understand that
        the two newer systems provide interesting interactions with threading systems.
        That does not seem like a reason to dump a whole language, a language with
        multiple independent healthy implementations (jRuby, Rubunius, Maglev, etc...),
        particularly when some of them have fixed threading performance. \\n\\nOr
        maybe I am missing the point, maybe this is just about jumping to some popular
        new toy now that us old fogeys are onto Ruby? Of course not, all the people
        I read about in blogs and watch in talks at the countless Ruby conferences
        seem like pragmatic people interested in getting stuff done. Ruby seems like
        an excellent tool for getting stuff done. It is extremely easy to express
        complex ideas quickly. It has an excellent system for handling libraries.
        It has access to awesome performance via its C-API. If C is not your thing,
        It is mature enough that it is getting performance optimizations with every
        new release (of MRI/Yarv at least). These people invested significant time
        and effort learning Ruby, will their pragmatism just let them throw that away?\\n\\nPerhaps
        my perspective is wrong and no-one is leaving Ruby? But it seems every other
        conference talk someone mentions Elixir while spitting Ruby's name.\\n\\nPerhaps,
        There is something to Elixir/Node I have completely missed? I read their docs
        and perused their libraries. They are missing features (and sometimes stability)
        like tools only a few years old would.\\n\\nWhy leave Ruby?\", \"likes\":

        ----\\n\\nwhich was empty and so I decided to **post my first code snippet
        there**.\\n\\nSadly nobody reacted so I have to assume that this project is
        dead. But what about you? *Anyone interested in bringing some of the Kinect
        functionality to Ruby?*\\n\\n\\n**What ~~I~~ we managed to do:**\\n\\n * Control
        the Kinects motor\\n * Control the Kinects LED\\n * Get accelerometer data\\n\\n**What
        is missing (tried but failed):**\\n\\n * Get an image from the RGB cam\\n
        * Get an image from the depth cam\\n * ~~Get accelerometer data~~\\n\\n\\n\\n**TL;DR:**
        Started to develop a pure Ruby Kinect driver. Who wants to help?\\n\\nPS:
        I'm not interested in libfreenect wrappers, I want to create a pure Ruby driver.
        (only with libusb i.e.)\\n\\n\\n**EDIT: I've put what I got so far on GitHub:

        class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fundamentally do not understand the perspective
        many Rubyists have. I am not saying it anything is bad, I am saying &lt;em&gt;I
        do not understand&lt;/em&gt;. I just have a different perspective. I don&amp;#39;t
        understand why pragmatic people who don&amp;#39;t seem to be early adopters
        are leaving a good tool for tools that should only appeal to early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please,
        let me explain my perspective. I have been working primarily with C++ the
        past 15, during that time I have dabbled with Java, PHP, Lua, Perl, Pascal,
        HTML/CSS, a couple kinds of assembly, C#/VB, others I wish I could forget
        and of course plain old C. I keep going back to C++ because I have a strong
        proficiency with it. I have the feeling I can make it do anything. I have
        made it solve some interesting problems. There are other reasons too, but
        this seems like enough to convey where I am coming from. I invested real time
        and effort gaining that proficiency, so I will use C++ when practical an invest
        more time learning something else when C++ is not practical.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I
        see a ton of Rubyists talking about Elixir and Node.js as somekind of wholesale
        replacement for Ruby. I understand that the two newer systems provide interesting
        interactions with threading systems. That does not seem like a reason to dump
        a whole language, a language with multiple independent healthy implementations
        (jRuby, Rubunius, Maglev, etc...), particularly when some of them have fixed
        threading performance. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I am missing the
        point, maybe this is just about jumping to some popular new toy now that us
        old fogeys are onto Ruby? Of course not, all the people I read about in blogs
        and watch in talks at the countless Ruby conferences seem like pragmatic people
        interested in getting stuff done. Ruby seems like an excellent tool for getting
        stuff done. It is extremely easy to express complex ideas quickly. It has
        an excellent system for handling libraries. It has access to awesome performance
        via its C-API. If C is not your thing, It is mature enough that it is getting
        performance optimizations with every new release (of MRI/Yarv at least). These
        people invested significant time and effort learning Ruby, will their pragmatism
        just let them throw that away?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my perspective

        SC_ON --&gt;\", \"selftext\": \"I fundamentally do not understand the perspective
        many Rubyists have. I am not saying it anything is bad, I am saying *I do
        not understand*. I just have a different perspective. I don't understand why
        pragmatic people who don't seem to be early adopters are leaving a good tool
        for tools that should only appeal to early adopters.\\n\\nPlease, let me explain
        my perspective. I have been working primarily with C++ the past 15, during
        that time I have dabbled with Java, PHP, Lua, Perl, Pascal, HTML/CSS, a couple
        kinds of assembly, C#/VB, others I wish I could forget and of course plain
        old C. I keep going back to C++ because I have a strong proficiency with it.
        I have the feeling I can make it do anything. I have made it solve some interesting
        problems. There are other reasons too, but this seems like enough to convey
        where I am coming from. I invested real time and effort gaining that proficiency,
        so I will use C++ when practical an invest more time learning something else
        when C++ is not practical.\\n\\nI see a ton of Rubyists talking about Elixir
        and Node.js as somekind of wholesale replacement for Ruby. I understand that
        the two newer systems provide interesting interactions with threading systems.
        That does not seem like a reason to dump a whole language, a language with
        multiple independent healthy implementations (jRuby, Rubunius, Maglev, etc...),
        particularly when some of them have fixed threading performance. \\n\\nOr
        maybe I am missing the point, maybe this is just about jumping to some popular
        new toy now that us old fogeys are onto Ruby? Of course not, all the people
        I read about in blogs and watch in talks at the countless Ruby conferences
        seem like pragmatic people interested in getting stuff done. Ruby seems like
        an excellent tool for getting stuff done. It is extremely easy to express
        complex ideas quickly. It has an excellent system for handling libraries.
        It has access to awesome performance via its C-API. If C is not your thing,
        It is mature enough that it is getting performance optimizations with every
        new release (of MRI/Yarv at least). These people invested significant time
        and effort learning Ruby, will their pragmatism just let them throw that away?\\n\\nPerhaps
        my perspective is wrong and no-one is leaving Ruby? But it seems every other
        conference talk someone mentions Elixir while spitting Ruby's name.\\n\\nPerhaps,
        There is something to Elixir/Node I have completely missed? I read their docs
        and perused their libraries. They are missing features (and sometimes stability)
        like tools only a few years old would.\\n\\nWhy leave Ruby?\", \"likes\":

        did it for the challenge and to learn something new. About 6 months ago I
        a friend turned me on to Reddit and shortly after I discovered r/webdev. At
        the time I was messing around with PHP and Wordpress and had never heard of
        Ruby or Python. After a few weeks of hanging around on r/webdev I discovered
        Ruby and the Rails framework. I dived in and have been trying to teach myself

        on my second read through of Eloquent Ruby and have done the the Ruby tutorial.
        I practice and study every day. I try to come up with small projects to work
        on to try the new concepts I learn and to heIp me retain the what I read.
